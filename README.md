# Machine-Learning-Hot-Dog-Not-Hot-Dog-Image-Classifier
This Python program utilizes the Google Cloud Platform Vision API to label images as either "Hot Dog" or "Not Hot Dog." It takes a user-provided image URL or filename, sends it to the Vision API for analysis, and then displays the labeled image.
